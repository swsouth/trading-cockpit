"Martin S. Schwartz (""Buzzy"")","1980s stocks, futures, options; tape + TA",Disciplined intraday/swing trading with tight stops; multiple instruments; objective setups and quick loss-cutting.,Per-trade stop ≤ 1R; instrumentation to trade across symbols with shared risk budget; momentum entry after pullback to rising MA; daily loss stop and ‘go flat’ rule after 2–3 consecutive losses.

Timothy Sykes,Penny/low-float momentum,"Pattern-based long/short on low‑float, news-driven microcaps; exploit hype/momentum and subsequent fades.","Screen for float < 20M, >3× relative volume, news catalyst; premarket gap %; intraday parabolic extension short rules; hard borrow/locate check and max position size % of avg volume."
Steven Dux,Low-float small caps; short bias,Statistics-driven shorting of low-float parabolic moves; quick scalp exits; strict borrow/risk management.,"Spike detection: >40–80% day move + >5× volume; first red day short pattern; VWAP reclaim/lose logic; tiered take-profits at -10%, -20%; hard stop above prior high; SSR handling."
William O’Neil (CAN SLIM),Growth stock selection + timing,"Hybrid fundamental/technical system (CAN SLIM) with buy points from bases (e.g., cup-with-handle) and 7–8% stop rule.","Multi‑factor screener: EPS/Revenue growth, RS ranking; market regime filter; pattern detection of bases; precise pivot breakout with volume ≥40–50% above average; -7/8% stop and 20–25% profit‑taking rules."
Linda Bradford Raschke,Short‑term futures/equities; quantified TA,"High‑probability short‑term setups (e.g., 2‑period RSI, Holy Grail, Turtle Soup) with strict risk and daily process.",Codify edges: pullback-to-EMA with trend filter; failed-breakout (Turtle Soup) reversal rules; 2‑period RSI mean‑reversion bands; session-specific time stops; volatility‑adjusted position sizing.
Mark Minervini (SEPA),Growth/momentum stocks,SEPA with Trend Template + VCP (volatility contraction) to buy true leaders near pivots; tight risk.,Trend Template screen (price above 50/150/200-day MAs; MAs rising; RS strong); VCP detection (lower successive volatility + tight ranges); buy through pivot on volume surge; rapid sell if breaks 21/50DMA or pivot -3%.
Nicolas Darvas (Box Theory),1950s momentum boxes,Buy breakouts from defined ‘boxes’ with volume; trail stops below box; avoid noise and weak sectors.,Automatic box construction from swing highs/lows; entry on close above box top + volume filter; stop just below box bottom; sector/industry momentum confirmation; ignore names not meeting liquidity threshold.
Dan Zanger,Chart patterns in leaders,"Aggressive trading of high‑beta leaders using classic patterns (cups, flags); quick risk control.","Pattern library (cup-with-handle, ascending base, high‑tight flag); breakout day volume ≥2× average; staged adds on tight consolidations; sell rules on pattern failure or climactic volume spikes."
Paul Tudor Jones,Global macro + TA,Macro thematics with strong risk constraints; trend/range recognition via simple moving averages and momentum.,"Top‑down regime model; 200‑DMA trend filter; per‑trade risk cap (e.g., 1% account); min reward:risk ≥ 3–5:1; correlation‑aware exposure caps across assets; cut quickly if thesis invalidated."
Jim Simons / RenTec (Medallion),Quant; statistical arb,Purely data‑driven; short‑horizon predictive signals; heavy emphasis on execution and cost control.,"Signal ensemble (mean reversion, seasonality, microstructure); cross‑validated feature pipelines; slippage/fee modeling in backtests; portfolio optimizer with risk parity/constraints; continuous learning with guardrails."
Larry Williams,Futures; sentiment/seasonality,"Uses indicators like %R, seasonals, COT; known for 1987 WCCFT performance; swing timeframes.","Seasonality/weekly pattern models; COT‑based bias filter; Williams %R for overbought/oversold with trend context; fixed window exits (e.g., n‑day holds) + ATR‑based stops."
Tom DeMark,Timing indicators (TD Sequential/DeMarker),Proprietary exhaustion and trend qualification indicators to anticipate reversals/continuations.,"Implement open TD counts/Setups and Countdown completion; require confluence with trend filter (e.g., 50/200 DMA) and volume; restrict to higher‑timeframe context to reduce false signals."
Brian Shannon (Anchored VWAP),Price/volume with AVWAP,"Anchor VWAP to key events (earnings, gaps, IPO day) to define objective support/resistance and risk.","Automatic anchor suggestion (earnings, major gap, swing high/low, IPO); trade only when price reclaims/loses relevant AVWAP; use AVWAP bands for targets/stops; multi‑anchor confluence scoring."
